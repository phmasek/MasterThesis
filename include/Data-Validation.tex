\chapter{Data Validation}\label{section:data-validation}

This section introduces the result of executing parts of the experiment on self-driving truck that participated in the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge 2016 in the Netherlands. 

\section{Method}
The Pi Component from \ref{section:exp-units} is executed on the Volvo truck using precisely same hardware that is used in the experiment. The Pi component is run on the target system natively and within a Docker container. The major difference in this case in comparison to the experiment, is that all software components required for the Volvo truck to operate in a driver-less manner is started and run in the background in a native and Dockerized enviroment. Measurement points are then captured via the Pi Component to measure the impact in a real use case.
