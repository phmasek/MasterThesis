\chapter{Methodology}

In order to answer the research questions, an experiment was carried out following the guidelines presented by \cite{Andreas}. 

Two sets of runs for each RQ where 1 is without load and 1 is with load. 
	- we want to find wether there is a correlation between enviroment and performance depending on load 
Why not memory? Because is a RT system you allocate static memory to each component before execution. 

\section{Experiment}
The aim 

\subsection{Goals}
The goal of the experiment is to systematically evaluate the scheduling precision of running three sample applications in different execution enviroments. The execution enviroments are. 

Running application A in Linux using VanillaKernel version 3.18.25
Running application A within a Docker container using Vanilla Kernel version 3.18.25
Running application A in Linux using RT kernel 
Running application A within a Docker container using RT Kernel 

\subsection{Preparing the Target System}
Before the test can be carried out, the target system needs to be perpared with different systems.
