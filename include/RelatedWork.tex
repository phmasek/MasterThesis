\chapter{Related Work}
In this section we introduce (1) the process of identifying current literature and (2) outline current research on the performance overhead of utilising Docker.

\section{Gathering Related Work}
The snowballing search approach for systematic literature studies is used to find relevant literature on the topic of this paper. The snowballing approach is the process of using the reference list or citations of a paper in order to identify additional papers. The guidelines for conducting a snowballing search approach, presented by Wohlin \cite{Wohlin}, are followed. 

\subsection{Start Set}
In order to begin the snowballing search approach, a collection of papers are required. In order to identify a start set of papers, keywords are extracted from the research questions, taking synonyms into account. Formulating a search-string from keywords that are broad and cover multiple areas of research may result in collecting a vast amount of literature. For that reason, broad keywords are broken down into more specific and detailed keywords specific to this study. The resulting search string used for a provisional start-set is found in table~\ref{search-string}. \\


The search string was applied to the Scopus \cite{scopus} database which resulted in finding 215 papers. A screening process was then applied to the provisional start-set. The screen process included reading the title and abstract to determine if the paper is relevant to this study. The screening process resulted in finding 10 papers related to this study.

In total, 9 candidates for inclusion are identified. The 9 papers are:

\subsection{Iteration 1}\todo{this whole section is in the early stages}

We then applied techniques from snowballing, to go forward and backwards 

\subsubsection{Backward Snowballing}
\begin{labeling}{[{[}C10{]}]}
\item [{[}C1{]}]  	Contains 26 references and reference to C6. Found: P1
\item [{[}C2{]}]  	Contains 21 references and reference to C6 C4.
\item [{[}C3{]}]    Contains 47 references (reference check needed, maybe remove this one since its about ARM).
\item [{[}C4{]}]  	Contains 42 references and reference to C6, C2. Found: P1
\item [{[}C5{]}]  	Contains 46 references. Found: P1
\item [{[}C6{]}]  	Contains 50 references. Found: P1

\subsubsection{Forward Snowballing}
We use Google scholar here (seems better than scopus)
