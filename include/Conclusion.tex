\item running mutiple containers on different hosts as it has been seens that there is significant overhead regarding this (maybe something about the truck having multiple computing nodes) %http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7396222
\item running with the new LTS OS that has zfs storage drivers
\item windows and mac native support 
\item doing the experiment on arm
